        <h1>As of February 2025: brief reflections</h1>
        <span class="date">2025-02-28</span>

        <p>I worked on 5-6 issues in February. Most challenging
            <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16355/files">one</a> was related to Antlr Parser:
        </p>
        <pre style="background-color: whitesmoke;">
            <code>
        /**
        * @see &lt;a href="..."&gt; some description &lt;/a&gt;
        * @see &lt;a href="..."&gt;some description &lt;/a&gt;
        */</code>
        </pre>
        <p> 
        First <code>@see</code> Tag statement parses fine. In second one there is a parsing error because
            a white space is missing and description begins immediately after <code>a</code> closing Tag. Modifying the
            grammer for Javadoc to make whitespace optional did the
            job.

        <pre style="background-color: whitesmoke;">
                <code>
                | SEE_LITERAL (WS | NEWLINE | {!isNextJavadocTag()}? LEADING_ASTERISK)+
                (htmlElement (WS | NEWLINE)* description?
                | (reference | STRING)  (WS | NEWLINE)* ((WS | NEWLINE) description)?)</code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        But it was not as obvious at first. the whole Antlr parsing stuff was new to me plus
        when messing around with grammer, things
        can quickly go downhill. So after lot of debugging and help from fellow
        contributor, I eventually had it working.
        <br>
        For Gsoc, I'm interested to work on improving Checkstyle's coverage on Google-style java
        guidelines and on new OpenJdk java Style guidelines. I'll spending next few
        weeks learning about these guidelines in detail and drafting my proposal.

            I've also been trying to set-up Qemu emulator to play around with Riscv32i but there seems
            to be some problems with gnu-toolchain for riscv. btw if you are trying learn about
            Riscv ISA, check out this cool <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3by7evD3F53Dz2RiB47Ztp9l_piGVuus">playlist</a> I found
            after some resources-hopping.
        </p>

        <p>As for my Shakespeare marathon, I finished reading Othello and watched the 1995
            production of it. It's become my favorite of all Shakespeare's plays I&#39;ve
            read so far. Current rankings:
        <ul>
            <li>Othello</li>
            <li>the one in which there are fairies and magic and a play at the end of it.</li>
            <li>The Tempest</li>
            <li>Measures for Measures</li>
            <li>Romeo and Juliet</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I couldn&#39;t find Arden edition for this one. But I did get my hands on an
            old pages-turned-yellow The Macmilian Shakespeare edition from my college library. It was pretty good too.
            (At the back, last date of return was Augest 2004. I'm pretty sure I'm probably the first person
            to actually <i>read</i> it in 20 years). As an bonus, enjoy this wonderful
            <a href="https://youtu.be/lN4Kpj1PFKM?si=Mkv_2vQXXr85PUzd">lecture</a> on the play.
        </p>
        <p>I've also been enjoying Zadie Smith&#39;s White Teeth. Loved Samad Miah.</p>

        <p>My marks are going all time low. 63% last semester and it&#39;s not good for the kind of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monbukagakusho_Scholarship">scholarships</a> I&#39;m
            hoping to apply for. So I started spending 10-ish or so hours a week, doing
            college stuff- Maths, Networking and Databases.

        <p>Miscellaneous: Some days ago, I attended a marriage. At this point I can use all the 
          change-of-scenery I can get. Finished Daredevil second season, set-up this blog and 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfheqbqoGGg">Déjà Vu.</a>
